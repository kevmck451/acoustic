mission analysis



things i want to know


time of take off: what syncs the flight logs with audio
closest times to target
Threshold of detection: based on intensity of target
window of detection: based on experiments to see roughly how far away target can be detected. How much time is the uav below the thrshold?

generate json target data that can easily be imported into audacity
	text file with start /tab stop /tab label
	point sources have same start and stop




start with directory of stuff
    flight audio
        slightly processed: start couple secs before take off and couple secs after
    flight log
        csv with lat, long, alt, speed: time will automatically be added when exported
    target info
        type, SPL at distance
