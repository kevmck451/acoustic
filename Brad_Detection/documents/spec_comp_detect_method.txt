Data Loading
	The run_me method is invoked with various arguments including file name, file list index, error analysis type, standard deviation multiplier and a dataframe for storing the results.
	The method begins by loading three different types of signals from files: the noisy signal (passed as a parameter to the method), a pure diesel engine sound (the signal), and a noise file.

Data Pre-processing
	The method continues by allocating variable data and ensuring each file's data has the proper shape (lines 40-99).
	The signals (noisy, pure, and noise) are normalized (lines 101-108).
	These signals are then converted to mono, i.e., from 4-channel audio to 1-channel audio (lines 111-118).

Filter Application
	A Wiener Filter is applied to the normalized signals (lines 122-147). The filter is applied after averaging the measured signal and measured noise into one mono signal. It's applied to each of the four noisy signal channels.
	A Matched Filter is applied (lines 149-155). It's applied to the noise (which should return a PSD that detects no signal), the signal (which should return a perfect signal detected PSD), and the 4 noisy signal channels (which would fall somewhere in between).

Harmonic Spectral Transform
	The signals are converted to mono (if not already) for the Harmonic Spectral Transform (lines 157-159).
	The Harmonic Spectra of the signals are taken (lines 196-198).
	If normalization was chosen after the filters or both before and after, it's performed (lines 200-203).
	Each signal is then interpolated with fewer points (lines 205-210). This is done to fix any change in array sizes due to filter application or the Harmonic Spectral Transform.

Harmonic Data Analysis
	Details of the harmonic data are recorded including the mean, the standard deviation, the max peak, and the frequency at which the max is present (lines 222-235).

Data Thresholding
	A standard deviation multiplier algorithm is applied to drop data below a certain threshold (lines 241 and 242).
	Error Analysis and Hypothesis Formation
	Errors are recorded and a hypothesis is formed (lines 243-254).
	The dataframe for the processed data file is then returned.
