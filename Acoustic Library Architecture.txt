Acoustic Library Architecture


- Is there a target present in this sample?
- Where is it? (given in coordinates)
- Can you tell me what type of target it is?



Process
- Flight Data Collected
- Program identifies launch sequence and starts target detection
- Creates timestamps for possible indications of targets present
- Pairs timestamp with location to return spatial coordinates
- Displays image of location with target locations



- Create a new sample:
	- Open a audio file (filepath)
	- Preprocess


Get a snapshot of everyfile (temporal, spectral, spatial)
extract useful info for modeling / analysis




Classes:

	- Sample: everything to do with the sample that's being processed. this will continue to be udpated throughout the processing process to get a complete picture of sample. this represents "The Scene". all the details about every part of the sample. space, enviornment, targets, noises, position
	
	- Acoustic: everything to do with audio data - i/o, preprocessing, processing, plots, analysis. all corrections will happen here including microphone, environment, noise reduction.

	- Sound Sources: everything to do with info and funtions needed to model sound sources. UAV & Engine characteristics like intensity, temporal, spectral, spatial. Will involve doing experiments with equipment to aquire the specs to model the object. Depending on the perspective, the objects will either be considered a target or noise.







- Sample
	- Noise
		- Ambient
	
	- Distance from Noise
	- Distance from Target
	- Sound Source
	- Enviornment
	- Noise Source
	- Position
	- Altitude
	- movement: bool (false = static / true = dynamic)


- Audio
	- Preprocessing
		- import / export
		- cropping: start time / end time
		- time stamping

	- Processing
		- time stamping
		- fourier transforms
		- noise reduction
		- thumbnail visiualizations
