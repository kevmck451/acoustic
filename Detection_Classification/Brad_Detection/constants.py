# Constants for Acoustic Sensing

# Speed of Sound (Temp / Humid / Pressure)
# 343 m/s at 20 degrees C at sea level
SPEED_OF_SOUND = 343


# Density of Air (Temp / Pressure)
# 1.225 kg / m^3 at sea level
AIR_DENSITY = 1.225


# Atmospheric Absorption (freq / Temp / Humid / Pressure)
# AA coefficients


# Microphone


#dB Weighting
dB_WEIGHTING = "Z"

SINEWAVE_AMPLITUDE = 0.75

REFERENCE_FREQUENCY = 1000




# SPL Reference: micro Pascals
# threshold of human hearing at 1kHz
SPL_REFERENCE = 20 * 10^-6

# Sample Rate: Hz (samples / sec)
SAMPLE_RATE = 48000
