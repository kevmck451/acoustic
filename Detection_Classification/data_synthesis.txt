File to take isolated sound samples are create a dataset to train a CNN model

Loudness of UAV will be fixed bc that's not really changing
Wind noise will be relatively fixed, but ideal, mount will reduce this as much as possible. Speed also plays a role
relate loudness of sample to a distance from target


Test 1: Ambient Noise Fixed / Target sound varies:  see what's the softest target can be before detection fails
Test 2: Wind Noise Fixed / Target sound varies:  see what's the softest target can be before detection fails

Testing Samples


Synthesizing Audio Data:
- Set Noise Floor: Ambient / Wind / Drone+Wind
    - Compress
    - Normalize
    - Create Chunks of 10s

- Get first target sample
    - Discard samples less than 10s
    - Compress
    - Normalize
    - Create Chunks of 10s
    - For each chunk:
        - For range of amplify values
            - Put target sample to amp value
            - Random Select a chunk from list
            - Mix 2 samples into mono sample
            - First sample NAME_00_00
            - Export sample



after creating variation in target loudness in sample, need to vary the amount of time the target's sound is present in the sample
